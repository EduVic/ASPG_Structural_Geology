## Fact, Terms and Definitions

> A *matrix* is rectangular array of items arranged in rows and columns.

Our implementation is focused on real matrices, that is, matrix elements are
real (complex) numbers represented `by float` type.

- Matrix Dimension: The number of rows and columns that a matrix has is
  called its dimension or its order. By convention, rows are listed first;
  and columns, second.

- Identity Matrix: ...

- A *square matrix* is a matrix with the same number of rows and columns (n × n).

- A *square diagonal matrix* is a square matrix 

- A *scalar matrix* is a square diagonal matrix with equal main diagonal entries.

- Row Vector: Matrix of dimension 1 × n.

- Column Vector: Matrix of dimension n × 1

- Idempotent Matrix: ...

- Rectangular Diagonal Matrix

- Symmetric Diagonal Matrix

- Size - The *size* of a matrix is defined by the number of rows and columns that it contains.
- Dimensions - A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an m × n matrix or m-by-n matrix, while m and n are called its dimensions.
- Row Vector - Matrices with a single row are called row vectors
- Empty Matrix - In some contexts, such as computer algebra programs, it is useful to consider a matrix with no rows or no columns, called an empty matrix.

-  block matrix
